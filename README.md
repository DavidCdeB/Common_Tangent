# Statement of the problem

Say we have two curves `f(x)` and `g(x)`:

![Data flow](https://github.com/DavidCdeB/Common_Tangent/blob/master/Images_for_README_md/x1x2_small.png)

the slope of the common tangent can be obtained as:

```slope of common tangent = (f(x1) - g(x2)) / (x1 - x2) = f'(x1) = g'(x2)```

So that in the end we have a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns:

```
f'(x1) = g'(x2) # Eq. 1
(f(x1) - g(x2)) / (x1 - x2) = f'(x1) # Eq. 2
```
We would
